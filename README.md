# Erato-GB

This is a simple gameboy emulator I decided to write to learn more about zig and to understand more about the world of emulation.

Progress is slow-moving, do not expect this work anytime soon, but I'll update the readme as things move along!.

## Ops

The op list left to complete for the cpu is in [the TODO.md](./TODO.md). I'm slowly implementing these as I go.
